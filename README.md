# NHANES 2018 PROJECT



Diabetes is a metabolic illness that involves hyperglycemia because of a lack of insulin production or 
insulin activity. It is strongly influenced by lifestyle-related factors such as physical activity levels. We aimed to 
study the effect of physical activity levels on diabetes status.


Demographic characteristics were compared between diabetic and nondiabetic participants. Multiple 
logistic regression models were used to assess the link between different physical activity levels and diabetes. 
Results: Participants with moderate to high physical activity levels had a higher prevalence of diabetes. Also, the 
multivariate logistic regression result showed that compared to those with moderate to a high level of physical 
activity, subjects with no reported physical activity levels had higher odds of being diabetic.

A physically active lifestyle may decrease the risk of diabetes. Further studies with larger sample 
size, also involving other countries, are needed to verify and strengthen the association between physical activity 
and the risk of diabetes. It is critical to improve the awareness of physical activity to prevent diabetes.
